What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A new empty repository is created in the current directory.  You need to do it so that you can then add files to the repository and create commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It stores the data so that it can then be added to the repository.  Not really sure.
